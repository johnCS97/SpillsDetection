# Oil Spill Detection System Using UAVs
## Project Overview
This system leverages Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs/drones) to detect, monitor, and report oil spills in marine environments in real-time. The solution focuses on three key strengths:

1. Origin detection: Identifying the source of oil spills
2. Live feed detection: Real-time monitoring and analysis
3. Alert system: Immediate notification of detected spills

## System Architecture
1. Data Acquisition Layer

- UAV Platform: Drone hardware with flight control systems
- Sensor Suite:

	1. RGB cameras for visual detection
	2. Multispectral/hyperspectral sensors for spectral signature analysis
	3. Thermal cameras for temperature differential detection


2. Data Processing Layer

- Image Processing Pipeline: Pre-processing, enhancement, segmentation
- Detection Algorithms: Machine learning/deep learning models for oil identification based on density heatmaps
- Tracking System: Temporal analysis for monitoring spill evolution and origin tracing
- Integration with AIS: Ship tracking data correlation for potential source identification

3. Communication Layer

- Real-time Data Transmission: From UAVs to ground station/cloud
- Alert System: Notification protocols for relevant authorities
- Data Storage: Cloud-based system for historical data and analysis
